# Hello!

Here is my proposed solution for the "PhotoAlbum"

The project is done entirely in Kotlin and the selected architecture is MVVM clean.

Used technologies:

Api communication - Retrofit2, Okhttp3
DI- Hilt
ViewBinding
Coroutines(Used this over Rx as latest trends, also added commentd code with Rx that can be used with few modifications to code and testcase)
LiveData
Unit testing - JUnit4, mockk and google truth
Material design
Possible improvements:
Properly Handel Glide issue to load images from placeholder website
Add UI test cases.

Better use of theme features (Dark and Light themes are almost the same now).
Landscape and portrait both supported.
Thank you for your time!
