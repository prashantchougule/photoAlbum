# Hello!

Here is my proposed solution for the "NewsApplication"

The project is done entirely in Kotlin and the selected architecture is MVVM clean.

Used technologies:

Api communication - Retrofit2, Okhttp3
DI- Hilt
ViewBInding
Coroutines
LiveData
Unit testing - JUnit4, mockk and google truth
Material design
Errors: Method displays error in toast(can handle all error)
Possible improvements:

Better use of theme features (Dark and Light themes are almost the same now).
Landscape and portrait both supported.
Thank you for your time!
